### Hi there, I am Benjamin from Lyon 👋

I have just finished a Full-Stack (REACT/NODE) 👨‍🎓 training session at the Wild Code School, and I am looking for a company for a coop training course starting in September.

💼 You can visit my projects online on my Portfolio: http://www.benjamin-chaillan.fr

💡 My latest full-stack project is not yet available on github, but you can see some videos on my portfolio (EXTERNATIC).
